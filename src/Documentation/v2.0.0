-> local uses: local uses of a stmt 'A' gives us a list of stmts which depend on stmt 'A'
-> local defs: local defs of stmt'A' and local 'L' gives Latest, most valid definition of a local 'L' in the context of stmt 'A'

-> Anchor: It is a stmt which is one of the following
    1.Return statements
    2.function calls
    3.field asssignments
    4.array Assignments
    5.conditional branches
    6.goto Statements
    7.Return Void statements
    

-> LocalUses.getUsesOf(Unit s) this function gives us a java list of all local uses of s 


Approach:

    1.  Iterate through every statement of the code and for each statement 
        a. If it's an anchor statement, analyse backwards and every stmt connected to it is tagged as live
        b. otherwise tagged as dead

    2.  Once the pass completes, We traverse through the code again and delete all the stmt that are tagged as dead
        and all field references that have no dependants after deep checking both the LHS and RHS for Locals are also deleted
